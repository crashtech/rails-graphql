# Description

`rails-graphql` is a fresh new implementation of a GraphQL server, designed to be
as close as possible to Rails architecture and interfaces, which implies that it has
shortcuts, lots of syntax sugar, and direct connection with Rails features like
**ActiveRecord** and **ActionCable**.

This gem has its **own parser**, written from scratch, using the
**C-API of Ruby**, which empowers it with an outstanding performance.
Plus, all the features provided were carefully developed so that everyone will feel
comfortable and able to apply in all application sizes and patterns.

# 3 Simple Steps

## Install

```bash
# Add the gem to your Gemfile
$ bundle add rails-graphql
# Then run the Rails generator
$ rails g graphql:install
```

## Define

```ruby
# app/graphql/app_schema.rb
class GraphQL::AppSchema < GraphQL::Schema
  field(:welcome).resolve { 'Hello World!' }
end
```

## Run

```bash
$ curl -d '{"query":"{ welcome }"}' \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -X POST http://localhost:3000/graphql
# {"data":{"welcome":"Hello World!"}}
```
