# The Basics

> `rails-graphql` is a fresh new implementation of a GraphQL server, designed to be
> as close as possible to Rails architecture and interfaces, which implies that it has
> shortcuts, lots of syntax sugar, and direct connection with Rails features like
> <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">ActiveRecord</a>
> and <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_cable_overview.html" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">ActionCable</a>.

This gem has its [own parser](/guides/parser), written from scratch, using
<a href="http://silverhammermba.github.io/emberb/c/" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">Ruby C API</a>,
which empowers it with an outstanding performance. Plus, all the features
provided were carefully developed so that everyone will feel comfortable and
able to apply in all application sizes and patterns.
