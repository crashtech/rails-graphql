          Directives provide a way to describe alternate runtime execution
          and type validation behavior in a GraphQL document.

          In some cases, you need to provide options to alter GraphQLâ€™s execution
          behavior in ways field arguments will not suffice, such as conditionally
          including or skipping a field. Directives provide this by describing
          additional information to the executor.
